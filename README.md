# Sitecore.WorkboxPlus v1.0
Enhanced Workbox for Sitecore

This extends the default Sitecore 8 Workbox to include the following:

- A user filter to only show items that belong to the current user (for the Workflow States specified in the config file e.g. Draft only).
- grouping of items at "Page Level" (this can be turned off in the config file using the "EnablePageLevelApproval" setting)
- A workflow action to submit a page and its children (ExecuteCommandOnItemAndChildrenAction). 
This has a parameter called "CommandName"; this is needed to specify which workflow command to run on the item and its children (e.g. CommandName=Submit).


Using the config file you can specify which item Templates to group under their parent (or "Page Level"). The ExecuteCommandOnItemAndChildrenAction only looks at these items.
